Here I want to discuss about the cocoa networking api, mainly NSURLSession package, to have a clear point of view on networking. So that, even though we use mostly third part frameworks like alamoFire(at least in my case), we can have a decent knowledge of what is going on underneath the framwork. 

# History
In the ancient time, when people dont even have smart phone(iphone in particular) or dont even have a phone, there is no much demand on the networking for any device or computer primarily.
